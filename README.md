# Photo-Blocks
The DApp for photographers built on a ETH Network with IPFS to authenticate ownership for the work of photographers. Also photographers can showcase their photographies to consumers for hiring them for an event and also helps the photographers to mint their photographies to NFT and our platform acts as a marketplace for that NFT's.

## Environment Setup 

### Minty
```
git clone https://github.com/yusefnapora/minty
cd minty
npm instal
npm link
start-local-environment.sh
```

### Deploy the Minty contract
```shell
minty deploy
```

### IPFS Deamon
```
npm install -g ipfs
jsipfs daemon
```
## Problem Identified
Every photoshoot is unique and valuable but there are no proper platform for the photographer to showcase their skills with their photo ownership. There are so many duplicate photo which makes the photographer to be discourage and also there is no revenue stream for the photographers.

## Inovative Solution
We developed an Web 3.0 application on ETH Network and our application interacts with the network using like Metamask wallet - browser extension. The Minty and IPFS used and store and mint the image for photographers. Client's can also view the photographer authenticated work and can able to hire them.

### Why Blockchain
Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.
Blockchain provides decentralization, it makes the people who are all using, to own an application in the internet.
