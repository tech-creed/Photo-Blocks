# Photo-Blocks
The DApp for photographers built on a ETH Network with IPFS to authenticate ownership for the work of photographers. Also photographers can showcase their photographies to consumers for hiring them for an event and also helps the photographers to mint their photographies to NFT and our platform acts as a marketplace for that NFT's.

## Problem Identified
Every photoshoot is unique and valuable but there are no proper platform for the photographer to showcase their skills with their photo ownership. There are so many duplicate photo which makes the photographer to be discourage and also there is no revenue stream for the photographers.

## Inovative Solution
We developed an Web 3.0 application on ETH Network and our application interacts with the network using like Metamask wallet - browser extension. The Minty and IPFS used and store and mint the image for photographers. Client's can also view the photographer authenticated work and can able to hire them.

## Environment Setup
